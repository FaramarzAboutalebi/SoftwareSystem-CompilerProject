# Compiler Project

### Ethan & Farmarz

### Todo List

- The code is able to pass the test case monExample.txt but we still need to work on it to pass the challengingIn.txt test case.
- Take care of the new errors and create new test cases for errors to demonstrate..
- Create as many test cases as possible, and for each test case, calculate the expected output. Then, compare the expected output with the code output.


#### Q:
- What would be the instructions for the end of each function?
- Can we have duplicated constants in different levels or different scopes?
