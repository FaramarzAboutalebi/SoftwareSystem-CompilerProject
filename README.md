# Software System - Compiler Project

## Collaborators: Faramarz Aboutalebi, Ethan Stein


## Developed a comprehensive compiler for the PL/0 programming language, including a virtual machine, lexical analyzer, recursive descent parser, and advanced parser with procedural constructs.
- Implemented a **P-machine** to execute PL/0 assembly code, featuring a segmented process address space for instructions and data.[[README]]([url](https://github.com/FaramarzAboutalebi/Compiler/tree/main/HW1#readme))
- Created a **lexical analyzer** in HW2 to tokenize PL/0 source code and generate lexeme tables.
- Developed a **recursive descent parser** in HW3 to analyze PL/0 program syntax, generate intermediate code, and integrate with the lexical analyzer.
- **Enhanced the parser** in HW4 to support additional grammatical constructs like procedures and calls, refining syntax error detection and reporting.
