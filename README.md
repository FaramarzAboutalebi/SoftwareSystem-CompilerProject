### Ethan & Farmarz

### Todo List

- [] Make

#### Q:

- What would be the instructions for the end of each function?
- Can we have duplicated constants in different levels or different scopes?

### Changes Ethan has made:

- At line 893 (subject to change), checking for level when looking for duplicate declaration. This fixed compilation of challengingIn.txt
- Note a new error: tc3_in, doesnt work as expected. Needs to be fixed
